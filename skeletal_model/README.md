The skeletal model for SlimeVR. Documentation for contributors can be found
[here](https://thebutlah.github.io/ferrous_slimevr/skeletal_model/).

## Goals
* Should be independent of networking/server
* Easily embeddable in other applications
* Support bindings to Java, and typescript via
  [deno_bindgen](https://github.com/denoland/deno_bindgen).

## Implementation Status
The basic graph structure is being worked on as we speak.
