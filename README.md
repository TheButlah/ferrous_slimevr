# THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO THE MAIN SLIMEVR ORGANIZATION!
https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Overlay

A Rust implementation of [SlimeVR](https://github.com/SlimeVR)

> ## Current Status
> The [skeletal model](skeletal_model/) is in the early stages of development. If you're
> really passionate about Rust and want to make this a reality, feel free to reach out to
> me on the official SlimeVR discord for questions.
> 
> ## Motivation
> * Fulfill the Rewrite It In Rust meme
> * Anger Java developers
> 
> ![Rust Evangelism Strike Force meme](https://external-preview.redd.it/Ikj0dtD2q1f70pJtxZEJahFAJH0LkkcdtNuxMWT8Dl0.jpg?auto=webp&s=1c6212f4d10bc678f00d19b36b99d0eba6a8ca79)

> Jokes aside, the official Java and C++ implementations of SlimeVR are here to
> stay, and thats a good thing. Many people know Java and C++, but not so many
> people know Rust. We should seek to port our work to Java and then upstream it
> to benefit the wider SlimeVR community, and give back to the mainline project.
> 
> There are however a few reasons for an alternative, experimental Rust implementation:
> * Some people are more proficient in Rust than they are in Java or C++
> * Having another implementation lets us validate the interoperability between the
>   firmware implementations and the server implementations
> * Opportunity to experiment with different architectural design in the code
> * Potential for performance improvements
> * Experiment with frameworks more bare-metal than arduino/platformio. I've had a *lot* of issues with the esp32-c3 on platformio.
